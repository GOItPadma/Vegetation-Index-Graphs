# Visualizating Vegetation Indices 

The program is written in python to visualize the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) time-series data. Vegetation Indices are very helpful in monitoring droughts, forest coverage and many more. The two most widely used indices are NDVI and EVI. <br>
To get the time-series data Google Earth Engine can be used. It helps in extracting the values and do all the data preprocessing. There is a guided project in the youtube channel <b>Spatial Thoughts</b> on this topic.<br>

After extracting the values, the python script can be utilized. Things should be kept in mind:
<ul>
<li>The data files must be in csv format</li>
<li>The data files must be in the same folder as the script</li>
<li>The name of the files should be written in the array files_ndvi and files_evi</li>
<li>The time gaps of the two indices should be checked before running the code</li>
</ul>
